\subsection*{Introduction}

The existing Lab 6 apparatus seems capable of running a more compelling quantum
eraser experiment that uses entangled pairs.
Rather than marking the idler with its own ``which-way'' information, it is possible
to mark the \emph{signal} with the idler's path through the MZI.
Then by manipulating the signal, we can ``erase'' the which-way information
and restore self-interference of the idler in the MZI.

This experiment can be run purely by inputting new HWP and LP angles
into the PC-based control screen.
No changes are needed to the apparatus on the optical table.

We ensure that only horizontally polarized photons can travel the bottom MZI arm
to the idler detector D$_i$, and only vertical can travel the top.
The MZI HWP$_t$ in the upper arm is set to $45^\circ$ and the idler LP$_i$ at the
MZI output is set to $90^\circ$ (H).
Therefore, only H photons can travel the bottom arm
and pass the horizontal LP$_i$ filter.
Only V photons can travel the top arm and pass the horizontal LP$_i$ filter
-- they will encounter HWP$_t$ and assume H polarization.
H photons entering the top arm will become V polarized
and fail to pass the LP$_i$.

Using $| \Phi^+ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|HH\rangle + |VV\rangle)$
entangled pairs means that the signal's polarization marks which
path the idler can take through the MZI.
This prevents the idler from self-interfering in the MZI.
Adjusting the signal LP$_s$ to $45^\circ$ will erase the which-way information
by projecting the signal's polarization onto D.
This will restore self-interference of the idler in the MZI.

\subsection*{The Lab 6 quantum eraser}

In the prelab, we created the MZI operator $\hat{Z}'(\vartheta)$.
Let's compose a polarizer operator onto our MZI operator
to create a quantum eraser operator for the full Lab 6 experiment.

\paragraph{Linear polarizer operator}
Here's an operator for a LP at angle $\theta$,
operating on photons in the H=$90^\circ$, V=$0^\circ$ basis as we have been:

$$\hat{P}(\theta) = \left[\begin{matrix}\sin^{2}{\left(\theta \right)} & - \sin{\left(\theta \right)} \cos{\left(\theta \right)}\\- \sin{\left(\theta \right)} \cos{\left(\theta \right)} & \cos^{2}{\left(\theta \right)}\end{matrix}\right]$$


Since the MZI LP is placed at the horizontal output, 
we need an operator that applies the polarization filter $\hat{P}$
to the polarization component of the state in spatial state $|\psi_b\rangle$,
while leaving the polarization component in the top path $|\psi_t\rangle$ unchanged.
We can construct an operator $\hat{P'}(\theta)$
using projectors onto the spatial basis states:

$$  \hat{P'}(\theta) = (|\psi_b\rangle\langle\psi_b| \otimes \hat{P}(\theta)) + (|\psi_t\rangle\langle\psi_t| \otimes \hat{I}) $$

\paragraph{Operator for single photon}
And now we can compose $\hat{P'}$ and $\hat{Z}'$
to create an operator that encompasses all of the Lab 6 apparatus:

$$\hat{E}'(\theta,\vartheta) = \hat{P'}(\theta) \hat{Z}'(\vartheta)$$

We will use it with the MZI HWP$_t$ at $45^\circ$ and the
MZI LP$_i$ at $90^\circ$, so
$$
\hat{E}'_{45,90}\;=\;
\hat{E}'\!\left(\theta=90^\circ,\;\vartheta=45^\circ\right)
$$


\paragraph{Evaluating with single photons}

As desired, sending single horizontal or vertical polarized photons through
the experiment results in constant detection probabilities.
Such photons can only travel one of the arms, so there is no self-interference.
\begin{align*}
|\langle \psi_b,H |\hat{E}'_{45,90} |\psi_b, H\rangle|^2 &= \frac{1}{4} \\
|\langle \psi_b,H |\hat{E}'_{45,90} |\psi_b, V\rangle|^2 &= \frac{1}{4} \\
\end{align*}

Sending in diagonally polarized light produces a detection
probability that varies with phase delay.
Since diagonal polarization is a superposition of
$\frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|H\rangle+|V\rangle)$,
contributions from both arms can self-interfere.
\begin{align*}
|\langle \psi_b,H |\hat{E}'_{45,90} |\psi_b, D\rangle|^2 &= \frac{\cos{\left(\delta \right)}}{4} + \frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Extension to signal–idler pairs}

Each photon spans a four–dimensional Hilbert space
\((2\text{ paths} \otimes 2\text{ polarisations})\)
so a pair occupies
\(\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{s}}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{i}}\) (dimension 16).
\[
\hat{\mathcal{E}}=
\mathbb{I}_{4}\otimes\hat{E}'_{45,90},\qquad
\hat{\mathcal{P}}(\theta)=\hat{P}'(\theta)\otimes\mathbb{I}_{4},\qquad
\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\theta)=\hat{\mathcal{E}}\;\hat{\mathcal{P}}(\theta).
\]

\paragraph{Input state}

We prepare the Bell state with both photons in the \(b\)-path,
noting that the path state has no physical meaning for signal photons:
\[
|\Phi^{+}\rangle=
\frac{\,|\psi_bH\rangle_{\!s}|\psi_bH\rangle_{\!i}
      +|\psi_bV\rangle_{\!s}|\psi_bV\rangle_{\!i}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

\paragraph{Propagation}

After the optical elements
\[
|\Psi_{\mathrm{out}}(\theta)\rangle
=\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\theta)\,|\Phi^{+}\rangle.
\]

\paragraph{Coincident detection}
Coincidences are detected when:

(i) the \emph{signal} photon is detected, with no restriction on its path or polarization, and

(ii) the \emph{idler} photon is found in the \(b\)-path showing that it exited the MZI towards the D$_i$ detector, with no restriction on its polarization.

This is described by the projector
\[
\hat{\Pi}=\mathbb{I}_{4}\;\otimes\;
\bigl(|\psi_b\rangle\langle\psi_b|\otimes\mathbb{I}_{2}\bigr),
\]
so that the coincidence probability is
\[
P(\delta)=\langle\Psi_{\mathrm{out}}|\hat{\Pi}|\Psi_{\mathrm{out}}\rangle.
\]

\paragraph{Probability and amplitude}

With the signal LP$_s$ set to $\theta=0^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ the probability of
coincidence detections is constant.
The signal carries which-way information about which path the idler took
through the MZI, so the idler can not self-interfere.
\[
P(\delta)=\frac{1}{8}
\]

With the signal LP$_s$ set to $\theta=45^\circ$ the probability of
coincidence detections varies with the MZI phase delay $\delta$.
Projecting the signal onto the diagonal polarization erases the
which-way information and restores the idler's self-interference.
\[
P(\delta)=\frac{1-\cos\delta}{8}
\]
